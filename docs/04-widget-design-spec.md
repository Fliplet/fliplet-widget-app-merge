# App Merge Widget - Design Specification

> **Note:** This document describes the design specification specifically for the App Merge UI widget. For the complete App Merge project design including backend processes, Studio integration, and other system components, see [03-design-spec.md](./03-design-spec.md).

## Overview

This widget provides the user interface for configuring and monitoring app merge operations in Fliplet Studio. It is a web application that runs within an overlay in Fliplet Studio and guides users through a multi-step process.

### Widget Scope

This design spec covers the following UI components implemented by the widget:

1. **Merge Dashboard** - Initial state showing app info and merge options
2. **Step 1: Select Destination App** - Organisation and app selection
3. **Step 2: Configure Merge Settings** - Multi-tab item selection interface
4. **Step 3: Review Merge Summary** - Final review before merge
5. **Merge Progress & Completion** - Real-time monitoring and results

### Out of Scope

This design spec does NOT cover:

- Backend API implementation
- Studio menu integration
- Global code version control UI (separate feature)
- Organisation admin settings (separate feature)
- App locking backend logic
- Audit log implementation (widget only displays link)
