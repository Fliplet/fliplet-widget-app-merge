> **Full Project Scope:** This document describes the complete App Merge design specification including UI flows, backend processes, Studio integration, global code versioning, and all system components.
>
> **Looking for the Widget/UI scope?** See [04-widget-design-spec.md](./04-widget-design-spec.md) for the design specification specific to the App Merge UI widget that lives in this directory.

## States

1. User selects "Merge" option from the app card's "More" dropdown.
2. Overlay to select the destination app.
3. User redirected to “Merge” overlay. User selecting items to be merged.
4. User selected items and clicked “Review & Merge”. User redirected to “Review and Merge” screen.
5. User clicks “Merge”. User redirected to “Merge” screen.
6. User clicks “Open app” and redirected to the merged app.

## 1\. User selects "Merge" option from the app card's "More" dropdown.

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| “Merge app with…” option in a dropdown app settings list | Click on this option | Access this feature If user or organization doesn't have permission to merge |

## 2\. Overlay with “Merge Dashboard”

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Description text that will educate user what should be done before starting app merge: check for name duplicates, rename items to match name in order to be overwritten, warn that app merge configuration can not be saved. Show current state of selected (source) app: Name ID Org Region Published/Not Published Last modified (timestamp) Last modified by (user) Show instructions on what should be done next to merge app. Link to open audit log  **CTA**: Configure merge  | Click “Merge configuration” to start configuring app merge Close this overlay Open audit log   |  |

| User now see 3 steps, (indicating that user is on the first one): Select destination app Select items to merge Review merge summary Information that progress can not be saved on these steps until merge is initiated. Notify user that any users of the source & destination app in Studio will be unable to work on the app until the merge is complete | Proceed to the next step when first is completed.  Can go back to the dashboard Close this overlay  | Save progress |
| **Title** of the action “Select destination app” **Description** on what actions are required and what will happen next. Warn user that selected apps will be blocked for editing after proceeding to the next step, those apps also will not receive any updates until the merge is completed.   |   |  |
| **Organisation selection** (by default should be selected the same one). Inside the list user will see available list of organisations (Title, ID, region) that can be used for merge feature | Select other available organisation.  User can start typing and relevant organisation should appear at the top of the list.  | If user, organization or app doesn't have permission to merge it won’t appear in the list.

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| List of apps \- “More” dropdown: **CTA**: Merge with app… | Click on this action | To see this option if app/org/user permissions are not allowed to run merge |

## Audit log

1. Update current audit log to include merge audit log

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Merge audit log in the list of other logs, which will include: Date Category Log type App User Session id Data | Review audit log information, user sorting, filtering and export feature | Review app merge logs for more than a previous year |

Below is an example of merge audit log information

| Date | Category | Log type | App | User | Session ID | Data |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Organization admin settings

1. Ability to restrict which Organisations receive merges

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| In manage organization section \- Security tab: A setting that will restrict apps within this organization to be available for app merge | Turn on/off this feature | Select specific apps to be restricted |



## App UI (during the merge)

1. Both apps should not be available during the merge process and should be blocked from studio user to make any changes.

### User has an opened app in browser (merging or destination one):

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Overlay with information about ongoing merge. That app is not available to be edited during this process.  | User can close this overlay and he will be automatically redirected to studio home screen | User can’t make any changes to the app during the merge. |

###  User is trying to select app from a list of apps (in studio home screen)

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Label on the app card that indicates ongoing merge. Disabled action links | User can read information on the card User can proceed to  “app merge” from the list of actions  | click on links on the app card. Color will indicate that they disabled |

2. If user is trying to initiate another merge during ongoing merge

### User is trying to select app from the destination app list

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  App in the list with indicator about ongoing merge | User can see the app in the list  | unable to select this app as a destination app for merge.  |

3. ### If user is trying to edit data sources or files that belong to merging apps

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Data source or file in the list with indicator about ongoing merge | User can see Data source or file in the list | User is unable to click on data source or file in the list, or open “actions” dropdown. Text color indicates that DS or File can’t be selected. |

4. ### App maintenance mode

| What users see: | What can do: | What users are restricted from or unable to do |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Description on what is it and how it works Toggle to turn on / off maintenance mode Save button (saving in progress, saved success state) | Chage maintenance mode Apply changes by saving them | See this section if they don’t have app publisher permission |

   1. During the merge process, maintenance mode is also enabled on the destination app to prevent live apps from downloading updates during the merge. Maintenance mode ensures that users do not receive partial or unstable updates while the merge is in progress. App Publishers will be able to view the current maintenance mode status and toggle it ON or OFF as needed via the Studio UI.

## Needs Clarification

| Scenario/Question | Clarification Needed | Decision |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| User leaves the flow during the "merge" state. | Can progress be saved or will the user need to start over? How can user open merge UI? What happens if user loses internet connection? | Merge progress can not be saved utill user initiated merge. If user left merge process, apps should become available for editing again. If user lost interet connection before initiating a merge process \- progress will be lost and user needs to start over. If user initiated the process ad connevtion was lost, Fliplet should complete merge process ad user can review merge result after. |
| Can org admins manage who can initiate app merge? | Do we need a separate UI for Organization Admins to manage merge permissions between Organizations, or should this be embedded in the merge setup process? | Merge permission should be set up on the organization level by admin for all apps.  |
| Checkbox to overwrite appearance settings  | Will this overwrite global appearance settings and component settings? | Only global appearance settings |
| how much time merge will take | Can we calculate and provide a real remaining time left for merging? | We will show a step by step status and tell that it will take no longer then 5 min |
|  if user selected a screen \- will it automatically include DS and files that are associated with it or not?  | How would user know if he selected associated ds with screen/files | Suggested solution: **By default**: **All screens, DS, Files, Settings** are selected. User can “ucheck” all in each separate tab. If you **uncheck a screen, file, DS**, its dependencies remain included (so you don’t accidentally drop a DS that you actually wanted), but the summary will highlight that standalone DS/files are still slated to merge. Indicate in UI which “associated items” are loincluded  |
| The frontend must show real-time merge progress updates to users, including the type of item being merged and success/failure messages. | List of items (or this will be only Screens, DS, files, setting)?  |  |
| System will provide actions that can be done (e.g. try again, skip)  | List of actions that system will provide |  |
| Copy libraries as a part of file selection | What information can we show to the user? (Name, ID, Created, Type, Size, Associated screens, Associated DS \- these are columns in file tabel) |  |
